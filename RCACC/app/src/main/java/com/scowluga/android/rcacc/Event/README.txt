The function of "Event" has been replaced by a WebView containing a frame with the Google Calendar.

Maybe it will be revived one day, until then here is the FUNCTIONING code.


Take note (what I learned from writing it):
- set alarm
- notification
- dialogues
- navigation
- Pickers


This took a long time... may it rest in peace
learn from it in the future young one
