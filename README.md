<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>Hello and welcome to the 105 RCACC: a functioning android application on the Google Play Store.</p>
<p>If you haven't already, download the app <a href="https://play.google.com/store/apps/details?id=com.scowluga.android.rcacc&hl=en" target="_blank">here.</a></p>

<h2>Conception</h2>
<p>From when I joined, at age 13, cadets has had a profound effect on my life, helping me grow and develop as a leader. </p>
<p>In grade 11, I decided to apply my android development skills to help the cadet community, by creating a application that would help the corps run, communicate, and grow. </p>
<p>Cue the 105 RCACC: an app I decided to create that would not only increase the community presence of the corps through technology, but also help parents and cadets get important information-fast!</p>
<p>Thank you to everybody that helped make this application possible. Special thanks to my father, and Mr. Chuu of 105.</p>

<h2>Functionality and Code</h2>
<p>This application uses the DrawerLayout and NavigationView provided by Android Studio. Navigation changes are managed through the replacing of fragments</p>
<p>While there are a number of fragments, including the corps calendar, many Google forms, and information about the corps, the most important is the 'News' section</p>
<p>This section is synchronized across all devices through the use of SyncAdapter and ContentProvider, and the cloud storage of Google Drive.</p>
<p>Messages can be modified by staff, and these changes are transferred to other devices through a SQL database.</p>
