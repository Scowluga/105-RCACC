<h2>Conception</h2>
<p>From the day I joined, cadets has had a profound effect on my life, helping me grow and develop as a leader. </p>
<p>In grade 11, I decided to apply my android development skills to help the cadet community, by creating a application that would help the corps run, communicate, and grow. </p>
<p>Cue the 105 RCACC: an app I decided to create that would not only increase the community presence of the corps through technology, but also help parents and cadets get important information-fast!</p>
